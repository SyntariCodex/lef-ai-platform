# LEF AI Visualization Framework

## Overview
The LEF AI Visualization Framework implements a planetary system metaphor for displaying community interactions and resource flows, based on Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory and Vygotsky's Sociocultural Theory.

## Core Components

### 1. Planetary System Interface
```
[Global Sphere]
    └── [Regional Sphere]
        └── [Community Sphere]
            └── [Family/Individual Core]
```

#### Interaction Layers
- **Core (Family/Individual)**
  - Personal metrics
  - Direct impact measurements
  - Resource utilization

- **Community Sphere**
  - Local project status
  - Resource distribution
  - Collaboration metrics

- **Regional Sphere**
  - Inter-community connections
  - Resource flows
  - Impact propagation

- **Global Sphere**
  - Worldwide influence
  - Pattern recognition
  - Macro trends

### 2. Resource Flow Visualization
- Orbital paths represent resource movement
- Connection strength shown by path thickness
- Bi-directional flow indicators
- Real-time updates

### 3. Health Metrics Display
- Color-coded status indicators
- Dynamic scaling based on activity
- Threshold alerts
- Trend visualization

## Technical Implementation
