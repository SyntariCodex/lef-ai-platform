# Core Framework Consolidation Plan

## Components to Consolidate

### 1. Pattern Recognition System
- Current Location: Multiple implementations across services
- Target: Single unified pattern recognition service
- Steps:
  - [ ] Merge pattern detection algorithms
  - [ ] Standardize theme extraction
  - [ ] Integrate with Grok data stream
  - [ ] Optimize performance

### 2. Metaphor Generation
- Current: Distributed across different modules
- Target: Centralized metaphor engine
- Steps:
  - [ ] Consolidate metaphor templates
  - [ ] Create standardized mapping system
  - [ ] Implement validation framework
  - [ ] Add metaphor effectiveness tracking

### 3. Bridge Components
- Current: Multiple bridging implementations
- Target: Unified bridge service
- Steps:
  - [ ] Merge perspective analysis tools
  - [ ] Standardize resolution generation
  - [ ] Create common validation framework
  - [ ] Implement feedback loop

### 4. Evolution Tracking
- Current: Scattered across system
- Target: Centralized evolution service
- Steps:
  - [ ] Consolidate metrics collection
  - [ ] Standardize progress tracking
  - [ ] Implement unified storage
  - [ ] Create visualization pipeline
